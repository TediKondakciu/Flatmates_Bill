# Flatmates_Bill
This is a program which calculates how much each of two flatmates have to pay from the amount of a certain period.  
In order to perform the correct calculations, it needs as input the amount of a bill for a particular period and the days that each of the flatmates stayed in the house for that period. In the end it returns how much each flatmate has to pay.  
The program also generates a PDF report stating the names of the flatmates, the period, and how much each of them had to pay.
